# Player Injury & Rehabilitation Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes player injuries, rehabilitation outcomes, and biomechanical factors to uncover patterns that affect recovery and injury risk. The dataset includes individual-level information on injuries, rehabilitation programs, recovery efficiency, and biomechanical measurements such as jump height, knee angle, ankle flexion, speed, and reaction time.

The goal is to identify trends in injury frequency, recovery efficiency, and physical attributes that may influence rehabilitation outcomes, providing actionable insights for coaches, trainers, and performance analysts.

## Key Analyses

### 1. Injury Frequency
- Frequency of each injury type among players.
- Visualized with bar charts to highlight the most common injuries.

### 2. Rehabilitation Analysis
- **Rehab Time by Injury Severity:** Examines how injury severity impacts recovery duration.
- **Rehabilitation Efficiency vs Rehab Time:** Shows whether longer rehab programs lead to more efficient recovery.

### 3. Biomechanical Metrics
- Correlations between jump height, knee angle, ankle flexion, speed, and reaction time.
- Helps identify physical attributes that may influence injury risk or rehabilitation efficiency.

## Visualizations
- **Bar Chart:** Most common injury types.  
- **Boxplot:** Rehabilitation time by injury severity.  
- **Scatterplot:** Rehabilitation efficiency vs rehab time, colored by injury severity, with regression trendline.  
- **Heatmap:** Correlation of biomechanical metrics.

## Insights
- Severe injuries require longer rehabilitation, but efficiency can remain high with appropriate programs.  
- Ankle sprains are among the most common injuries, highlighting opportunities for preventive measures.  
- Players with higher jump heights and better knee angles often recover faster from lower-limb injuries.  
- Reaction time and speed appear to be independent of other biomechanical metrics.

## Technologies
- Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn)  
- Jupyter Notebook for interactive exploration and visualization
